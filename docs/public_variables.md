## Table: Variables

### Description

The `variables` table in the database is crafted to support a diverse array of observation types and units. This versatility is key to accommodating various ecological data formats, such as counts of individuals, weight, density, occurrences, and presence/absence data, among others. Each of these observation types can be associated with different units of measurement. The table facilitates the recording and categorization of these different types and units, making it a pivotal component for data analysis and interpretation in ecological studies. The `id_variables` column, found in other related tables like `observations`, references the `variables` table to specify the type of observation, providing a clear link to the detailed description and unit of the variable being observed.

### Dependencies

- Sequence: `variables_id_seq`

### Columns

| **Column Name** | **Type**            | **Description**                                                                   | **Constraints**                 |
|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **id**          | Integer             | A unique identifier for each variable.                                            | Primary key, Not Null, Default: nextval('variables_id_seq'::regclass) |
| **name**        | Character Varying   | The name of the variable, indicating the type of observation (e.g., count, weight, density). | Not Null, Part of Unique Constraint |
| **unit**        | Character Varying   | *Optional*. The unit of measurement for the variable, which may vary based on the observation type. | Not Null, Default: '', Part of Unique Constraint |
| **description** | Text                | *Optional*. A detailed description of the variable, explaining its significance and use in observations. | - |

### Additional Constraints

- **Unique Constraint**: `variables_name_unit_key` ensures that each combination of `name` and `unit` is unique within the table.
